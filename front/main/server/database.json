The TRUSSTIC® technology in the midsole generates better stability on the court, while the new tooling combines an EVA midsole foam with GEL® technology cushioning in the forefoot to increase shock absorption.

These shoes are designed to help you swing stronger and recover quicker between shots. ​Novak has a zero-step shot. This means that he’s swinging his racquet when he lands. By increasing the outsole’s contact area, the shoe creates a stable landing and reduces the load placed on the body. As a result, you’re able to put more energy into generating a powerful swing. ​For a smoother crossover step, this shoe allows you to perform quicker turns in a shorter timeframe. With good outsole grip and a TWISTRUSS™ support system, you can push off the ground with more force. This helps you quickly recover and get back to your ready position more smoothly.",
